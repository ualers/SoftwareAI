## 📖 About
# * **💭What is SoftwareAI?**
* SoftwareAI is an AI framework with the aim of creating a software/application development company/organization governed by AI, its purpose is not only to create the software with updates, landing page, technical and github documentation, schedules and spreadsheets, SoftwareAI is able to govern a software company completely with a CEO team, accounting team, support team, and all the teams that make up a software company
#
# * **💭How did SoftwareAI come about?**
Thu, July 18th at 4:17 pm OPENAI launched the GPT-4o mini, 60% cheaper than other models... This made my big project viable, a software organization/company formed by artificial intelligence, all the code will be open and free interpretation, however business applications created with Qt5 from SoftwareAI will be sold and made available at site
#
# * **💭What is SoftwareAI capable of?**
* in version 0.1.7, SoftwareAI is capable of creating software with a pre-project document, project roadmap, schedule, spreadsheet, requirement analysis, in addition to creating the software repository on github with the code, README.MD and description in addition to implementing 1 improvement through commit, in version 0.1 all teams that make up the organization have communication limited to importing python, there is still no intercommunication between teams

         # Documentação para o GitHub
         
         ## Introdução
         O **Conversor de Moedas** é uma aplicação Python que permite converter valores entre diferentes moedas utilizando taxas de câmbio obtidas de uma API. É uma ferramenta útil para viajantes, comerciantes e qualquer pessoa que precise realizar transações em múltiplas moedas.
         
         ## Instalação
         Para instalar e usar o Conversor de Moedas, siga estas etapas:
         
         1. **Pré-requisitos**:
            - Você deve ter o Python instalado em sua máquina. Caso ainda não tenha, faça o download em [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
         
         2. **Instalação de bibliotecas**:
            - Você precisará instalar a biblioteca `requests`. Execute o seguinte comando no terminal:
            
            ```bash
            pip install requests
            ```
         
         3. **Download do Script**:
            - Salve o código acima em um arquivo chamado `currency_converter.py`.
         
         ## Uso
         Para usar o Conversor de Moedas, siga estes passos:
         
         1. Execute o script no terminal:
            
            ```bash
            python currency_converter.py
            ```
         
         2. Quando solicitado, insira a moeda base para a conversão (ex: USD, EUR).
         
         3. O programa exibirá as taxas de câmbio disponíveis. 
         
         4. Digite a moeda de origem, a moeda de destino e o valor que deseja converter.
         
         5. O resultado da conversão será exibido em formato monetário.
         
         ## Referência de API
         - **CurrencyConverter**: Classe principal responsável pela conversão de moedas.
             - `__init__()`: Inicializa a classe definindo a URL da API de taxas de câmbio.
             - `get_exchange_rates(base_currency)`: Obtém as taxas de câmbio para a moeda base especificada. Retorna um dicionário de taxas.
             - `convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency, rates)`: Converte um valor de uma moeda para outra, com base nas taxas fornecidas.

     Improvements implemented in VOD Downloader: 1. Added option to…
     …user selects the output directory of downloaded files, improving usability and organization. 2. Implemented detailed error recording in a log file, facilitating debugging and providing useful information to the user. 3. Added progress bar for multiple downloads, providing visual feedback during the process. 4. Implemented functionality to cancel ongoing downloads, giving the user more control. 5. Allows you to choose the file output format (MP4, MKV), increasing flexibility. 6. Added desktop notifications for completing downloads, improving user experience.
